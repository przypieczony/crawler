Way of Working (WoW):

- All documentation, docstrings, comments, code will be written English.
- Do not commit directly to master. Pull requests with at least one reviewer 
  must be approved before it comes to master branch.
- Keep code clean, provide docstrings and follow these rules: 
  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
- Eat, sleep, code, repeat ;)
